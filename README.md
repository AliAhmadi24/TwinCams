# TwinCams: length measurement using stereo cameras
The primary goal of this project was to develop a code capable of accurately calculating the distance between two points in 3D space. Additionally, the provided code includes features such as image capturing, and stereo camera calibration, all implemented with simple commands to facilitate easy use when needed, so there is no need to write separate OpenCV codes for these tasks :)
